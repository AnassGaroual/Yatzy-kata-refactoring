# Yatzy-kata-refactoring

This is a code refactoring attempt of the kata problem described in https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata .
 This is  based on usage of java streams, variables, naming editing & more test unit use cases.
 Some further refactoring to do is the implementation of more best practices such as SOLID principles and design patterns to ensure maintainability and extensibility of the application.
